# Want to do well in this class?
The skills developed in this course can only be learned by practicing them. This will involve a *lot* of:
  * typing commands into your terminal,
  * testing the output to see if it worked,
  * modifying your commands, and trying again  

 You will do well in this class if you actively participate and are making good-faith efforts to complete all required activities. Ideally, you would revisit and practice newly introduced concepts more than once per week – even if only for a few minutes per day. If you prefer learning to solve the problems in groups, you’re free to meet up with other students outside of class, or to collaborate online. Simply copying someone else’s work and pasting it into the command-line is not making effort to practice computational skills.

 To get the most out of this class, I **highly** encourage you to attend our community's weekly *Biology Programming Hours* (Noon to 2:00 PM on Wednesdays, in PLSB 403).

## "...but I can't code"

 If this sounds like you, **perfect!** This course is designed for those without any prior experience with programming languages or computer science. We will use a combination of in-class guided activities and online interactive tutorials to get you up to speed. We will also have a [*Slack channel*](http://biol4585sp19.slack.com/) for tech help, so if you're having problems, you can easily submit a question.
